How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

To interpret user needs, you listen to what outcome they want to happen. You then figure out what is needed to make that happen. User stories help organize thoughts and point out what is needed to make the goal possible.

How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

It is good to look at the goals and the amount of users when approaching developing programs. Scrum is an agile process to incorporate in future developing work.

What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

Being a good team member means to be a positive part of the team. That means that you communicate issues and stay on track with your team.
